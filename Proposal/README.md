# Proposal

# Project Title

NYC Vehicle Collision Data Science Project

### Group Members

- Kazi Siam

- Ming Hin Cheung

### Proposal (First Time)

- In our project, we will investigate which borough is the most dangerous to drive around. We will also analyze when most vehicle-related accidents happen.

### Feedback from professor

- You might want to reframe this as something like “Can we predict which streets or intersections are most likely to have an accident?”

- Descriptive statistics and graphs are great, but you must build a model for this project.

### Proposal (Second Time)

- Can we predict how many accidents a borough would have in a month or year?

### Feedback from professor

- It’s unclear why we would want to predict the borough for each crash (the logistic regression model). Make sure you have a narrative about why this is relevant and interesting. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿

- Your current dataset is at the crash level, which means you can predict characteristics of individual crashes. 

- To predict how many accidents a borough would have in a month or year, think about what is correlated with car crashes (i.e. how many cars people have in the borough? Demographics of the borough?) and add features that are at the borough level. 

### Proposal (Final Time)

- Based on the information about the accident, can we predict in which borough did the accident happen?
