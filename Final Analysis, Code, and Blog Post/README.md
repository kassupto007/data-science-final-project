### Repository Structure
- `./../Dataset`

  - `Models.ipynb`: Includes the code for our models and the classification report.

- `Scripts Files`
  - `Models.py`: Script for our models and the classification report.

### Challenges
Describe any challenges you've encountered so far. Let me know if there's anything you need help with!

- We had to create a new repository because the old repository was over its data quota. We got an error message saying, “This repository is over its data quota. Account responsible for LFS bandwidth should purchase more data packs to restore access.” After doing some research on it, we found out that we either have to pay for the GitHub or wait a month for the bandwidth to reset. We tried to fork it but it still didn’t work.

### Contributions
Describe the contributions that each group member made.

- We worked as a team. We have done everything together via Zoom. Therefore, it was a 50/50 contribution.
